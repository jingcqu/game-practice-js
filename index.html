            <p>
                The Block is all powerful, the block is all knowing, the block is hollow and the block is empty.<br> The block is angry, the block is ignorant and the block ... <br> The Block is evil. <br> When humanity perceive the block; they fear it,
                they're excited by it, and they wish it away. <br> However, unlike the evils familiar, the block does not hide in the shadows but in the mundane.<br> Humanity was, is, and forever will be in reach of the block and they will forever turn
                their gaze away.<br> As it's evil slowly creeps: praying that fate has it that the block saves it's evils for those who face it.<br>
                <br> You are but a coward... look away and run
                <br> It's motherfucking block
